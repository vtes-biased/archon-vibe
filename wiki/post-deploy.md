# Post-deploy — what a production deploy unlocks

Actions that only become safe once a specific commit is live on production. The
board holds no waiting state and a subsystem page is no place for a runbook, so
they park here: one `##` section per item, **completion is deletion**, and an
empty page is the normal state.

`/post-deploy` runs them, ahead of the feedback issues it closes. Unlike the work
deferred in [vekn-decommission](vekn-decommission.md), a fired trigger here does
**not** go back through `/intake`: that trigger fires every release, and an item
reaches this page only after passing egress review, so the one decision left is
the owner's go/no-go.

**An item belongs here only if `/post-deploy` could execute it with nothing but
that go/no-go.** Work carrying judgment — reviewing a dedup's output, diffing Hall
of Fame membership either side of a backfill — stays a board line that happens to
have a production step. Without that boundary this page becomes a second board.

A section whose first line is **Migration** followed by a slug is the standing
proof of an entry in `backend/src/migrations.py`
([architecture](architecture.md#stored-value-migrations)). It has nothing to
run — the entry rewrote the rows before the process served — but its queries are
the only record that the rewrite reached a given database, so it is deleted only
once **every** long-lived one answers 0, and the entry it names dies in the same
commit. `just migration-pairing` fails on either half outliving the other.

**Every item names the commit that gates it**, so `git tag --contains <sha>`
answers whether a given deploy has made it actionable — the same check
`/post-deploy` already runs against a feedback issue's fix. An item states what
gates it and why, what to run, what proves it worked, and what it owes afterwards:
people to tell, and the wiki text that dies with it.

## Confirm the judge directory sync runs on production

**Gated on** the commit setting `judge_sync = "true"` in
`deploy/group_data/prod.py`. The first run was triggered by hand from the admin
panel; the daily 05:30 UTC job only exists once a deploy carries the flag.

**Run** nothing: after the first 05:30 UTC following that deploy, read the
vekn-status panel.

**Proves it worked**: *Judge directory sync* shows green with a run after the
deploy, and `preview_judge_sync.py` on the box prints `0 members would change`.

**Owes afterwards**: telling the VTES Exams maintainers the integration is live, and that
leaving the public directory or letting an accreditation lapse now removes the
Archon title. Delete this section.

# Cluster-wide postgres backup — iterates every non-template database in the
# cluster, dumps each to its own file (pg_dump -F c), dumps cluster globals
# (pg_dumpall --globals-only), optionally uploads to S3-compatible storage via
# restic (one repo per DB, plus one for globals), and prunes locally.
# Kept in sync with server-setup's files/pg-backup.sh (frankfurt runs that copy).
#
# Per-DB progress is logged via `logger -t <db>` so journald filtering picks it
# up alongside the app's other syslog streams. pg_dump / restic stderr lands
# under SyslogIdentifier=postgres-backup for a cluster-wide view.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   BACKUP_DIR, RETENTION_DAYS — required
#   EXCLUDE_DBS — optional space-separated DB names to skip: ephemeral DBs
#   (scratch/beta reseeds) whose backups have no recovery value.
#   BACKUP_HEALTHCHECK_URL — optional dead-man's-switch ping (healthchecks.io
#   style: GET on success, GET <url>/fail on failure), from healthcheck.env.
#   Remote upload is enabled by the presence of RESTIC_REPOSITORY_BASE, which
#   comes (along with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY /
#   RESTIC_PASSWORD / REMOTE_KEEP_{DAILY,WEEKLY,MONTHLY}) from
#   /etc/postgres-backup/remote.env, loaded via the service unit's
#   EnvironmentFile= when remote backup is enabled.

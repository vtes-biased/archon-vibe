# Board

A list designed to shrink. **The goal is zero.** Completion is deletion — there is
no closed state, no archive; git history is the record and `git blame` knows a
line's age.

**Order is priority.** Ranking rules, applied top to bottom when two unrelated
lines compete:

1. user-reported defects
2. correctness
3. blocking work and useful refactorings
4. polish
5. new capability

**Hard limit: 15 lines.** Adding a sixteenth forces a drop or a promotion to the
wiki. **No waiting state**: externally-gated work is deferred on the wiki page
that owns it — see [wiki/vekn-decommission.md](wiki/vekn-decommission.md) — with a
named trigger, and returns through `/intake` when the trigger fires.

**Every line must be completable** — if "done" cannot be stated, it is a subject:
promote it to a [wiki](wiki/index.md) page and delete the line. Context lives in
the wiki; asks live here. Bulky context for an in-flight line goes in
`board/<slug>.md`, deleted with the line.

Board changes ride the commit that earns them.

- Put the drafted question set to the Rules Director on no-final tournaments and record the answer — our engine is rules-literal and awards no winner or finalist rating without a played final, while vekn.net credits a no-final top five exactly like a final. The question that matters most to us is the one the rules do not cover: whether an event that lost its final to force majeure rates at all, since we allow a no-final finish at any size. **Done when** the answers are in `wiki/domain/`, and either the engine changes or the no-final note in `wiki/tournaments.md` cites the ruling. Context in `board/no-final-rating.md`.
- Finish the production cutover's post-flip steps: install the Discord bot on the production guild(s), set the portal redirect URIs, ToS and privacy URLs and the Linked Roles Verification URL for archon.vekn.net, then run the improved dedup on production (`--probe-vekn`, review, `--apply`) and tell the waiting organizer his event can be finished. **Done when** the bot is installed, the portal is configured, the dedup is applied and the organizer has been contacted. Context in `board/prod-migration.md`.
- Decommission legacy archon: final `pg_dump` archive of `archondb`, remove the `archon_web` systemd unit, archive the old repository read-only, cold-store the `tournament_events` dump, and retire the `new.` hostnames — the hand-edited 302 vhost, its certbot cert and its DNS A record, on both archon.vekn.net and krcg.org. **Done when** none of those exist and the archive is stored. Context in `board/prod-migration.md`.
- Give third-party apps a daemon identity and put the public API online: a `client_credentials` grant issuing short-lived stateless `oauth_client` JWTs (no token row — revocation is the client's active flag) with an `api:read` scope valid only on the public API, plus its own systemd unit and an nginx vhost on the `api.` subdomain that rate-limits repeated corpus reads per address without slowing a single one (`limit_req` bursting to a whole refresh, a `limit_conn` cap generous enough to survive NAT, 429 not 503), gzips `application/x-ndjson` and never buffers, and a beta deploy. **Done when** a registered client can mint a daemon token and read the beta API with it, the main app rejects that token, one full refresh runs unthrottled while a tight loop of them is refused, and `wiki/access.md`, `wiki/dev.md` and `wiki/public-api.md` record the grant, the throttle and the deployment. Context in `board/public-api.md`.
